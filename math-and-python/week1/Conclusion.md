Week1  python things   kind of  trivial .
What  could  apply from here   to make  my  models    better or  in  project implementantion  could   be :
i) Lambda  functions;
ii) Generators  instead  of list  comprehension  for  lazy  evaluation;
iii) See if  i) and ii) could be used   in map reduced style;
